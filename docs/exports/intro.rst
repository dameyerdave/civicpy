Exporting
=========

CIViCpy supports exporting of CIViC records to Variant Call Format (VCF) files.
This enables downstream analyses such as integrating with `IGV`_, `VEP`_, and
other common bioinformatics tools. VCF exports are maintained via the :module:`exports`
module.

Other file formats are planned for future releases. Suggestions are welcome on our
`GitHub issues page <https://github.com/griffithlab/civicpy/issues>`_.
